# Lab00 - Hello World

## Points: 1 (Autograde Only)

## Submission
`commit` and `push` your code to the `master` branch on the remote GitHub repository **before** the deadline.

Your source file **must** be named `hello.c` for the autograding to work.

## Clone
`clone` this repo to repl.it or your local machine using the link provided on the GitHub repo page

## Description
In this assignment, you are to create one of the most basic C programs possible: Hello world.

All the program has to do is print `Hello world` to the terminal to score 100%. This task will prove:

1. You are able to access the programming environment
2. You are able to write a simple C program (using course videos for reference)
3. You are able to submit code to GitHub for scoring

All of these items are critical for success in the following 11 weeks.

## Requirements
Use `printf` to output the string `Hello world`.

## Example Output
`$` is the prompt - you do not need to reproduce the `$`.

```
$ ./a.out
Hello world
$
```
