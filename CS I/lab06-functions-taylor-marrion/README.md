# Lab06 - Functions

## Points: 20 (Manual Review Only)

## Submission
`commit` and `push` your code to the `main` branch on the remote GitHub repository **before** the deadline.

## Clone
`clone` this repo to your local machine or the cs.dsunix.net machine using the link provided on the GitHub repo page

## Description
Complete the four functions specified using the prototypes in the template

1. average - returns the average of three integers
2. grade - return a grade based on a score (>= 92 == A, >= 84 == B, >= 76 == C, >= 68 == D, < 68 == F)
3. printByTwo - print the numbers in the range specified by start and stop, incrementing by two each time
4. area - accept the width and height of a rectangle and return the area

In main, demonstrate that each function works by calling it and printing results where necessary.

## Requirements
You must accept user input for the functions where appropriate for demonstrating each function.

Additionally, be sure to compose a well-formatted, readable program that includes useful variable names.

## Example Output
`$` is the prompt - you do not need to reproduce the `$` and your prompts do not need to match exactly. All inputs in this program exist after the prompts (which are denoted by `:`) 

```
$ ./a.out
Enter three integers to get the average: 4 5 6
The average of 4, 5, and 6 is 5.000000
Enter a score to receive a grade: 83
A score of 83 provides a grade of C
Enter a start number: 7
Enter a stop number: 15
Printing by 2 from 7 to 15
7 9 11 13 15
Enter rectangle width: 2
Enter rectangle height: 9
A rectangle of width 2 and height 9 has an area of 18
$
```
